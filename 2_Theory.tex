\section{Magnetic Confinement Fusion}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At a subatomic level, nuclear fusion is governed by two separate fundamental interactions; the electromagnetic force, which causes the positively charged positrons of two nuclei to repel each other, and the residual strong force, which binds together protons and neutrons to form nuclei. 
Due to their small size and low number of protons, nuclei of elements lighter than nickel and iron can overcome the electromagnetic repulsion barrier and fuse into a single nucleus, releasing typically orders of magnitude more energy than any process involving chemical bonds.

Since the nuclei have to be brought to within around $10^{-15}$ m from each other in order for the short ranged strong interaction to outweigh the electromagnetic repulsion, the process of forcing together even the lightest nuclei requires substantial amounts of energy.  
%At the cores of stars, the immense pressure combined with temperatures of the order of $10^6$ K brings hydrogen atoms close enough for some of them to cross the repulsion barrier thorugh the quantum mechanical effect of tunneling. \cite{clayton1983principles}
Without the gravitational mass of a star compressing the fusion fuel, we have to rely on various 'dirty tricks' to achieve conditions suitable for a self-sustaining fusion reaction. 
The most promising of these tricks, Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) (in contrast to gravitational confinement in stars) makes use of the fact that charged particles can be manipulated using magnetic fields. 
At the temperatures of several tens of millions kelvins needed to achieve thermonuclear fusion, the electrons and nuclei of the fuel will have separated, leaving us with plasma. 
The goal of current MCF projects is to control this plasma using arrays of strong magnets and thus be able to confine it and prevent it from contacting the reactor walls. 

Research focusing on MCF has been conducted since the 1950s, with multiple reactor designs, such as the stellarator, Z-pinch and levitated dipole having been proposed troughout the years. 
Currently seen as the most auspicious design for an MCF reactor is nonetheless is the tokamak, originally developed and first constructed in the 1950s by Soviet physicists \cite{tokamakorigins}. 
The reactor type is best described by its name, "tokamak", which is a Russian acronym for a "toroidal chamber with magnetic coils".

In principle, any two light enough elements can be fused. 
However, from an fuel economical point of view, the deuterium-tritium reaction 
\begin{align}
^2_1\rm{H} ~+~ ^3_1\rm{H} ~\rightarrow~ ^4_2\rm{He} ~+~ ^1_0\rm{n} ~+~ 17.58 ~\rm{MeV}
\label{Eq:D-T-reaction}
\end{align}
can be considered favourable. 
Deuterium can be refined from hydrogen extracted from sea water and tritium can be produced through transmutation from lithium
\begin{align}
^6_3\rm{Li} ~+~ ^1_0\rm{n} ~\rightarrow~ ^4_2\rm{He} ~+~ ^3_2\rm{H} ~+~ 4.80  ~\rm{MeV}
\end{align}
using the neutrons released from either a fission or fusion reactor, potentially using specific tritium "breeding" structures on the inner surfaces of a tokamak \cite{giancarli2012overview}.

\section{Plasma Facing Components in Modern Tokamaks}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The extreme conditions contained within a fusion reactor impose strict requirements on the construction materials. 
Energetic neutrons and ions are constantly bombarding the plasma facing components, causing heating of the reactor vessel and erosion of the walls, potentially hindering the fusion process by dilluting the plasma with heavier atoms. 
In order to protect the vacuum vessel from the intense heat and the erosive effects of plasma particles, the inner walls are covered with a cooled and armored \textit{blanket}. 
In reactors such as the ITER or the Joint European Torus (JET) the blanket is often covered with beryllium \cite{raffray2012overview}, chosen due to its plasma contamination properties.

Located usually at the top and/or bottom of a tokamak, the \textit{divertor} is a device used to remove fusion products and impurities from the plasma and to shield the surrounding walls from the extreme heat and high neutron fluxes. 
Due to its task, the plasma facing surfaces of the divertor are subject to even more extreme conditions than those of the blanket, receiving heat fluxes of up to 20 MW/m$^2$ \cite{Iter1234Divertor}.

\section{Hydrogen Retention in Tungsten}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The armour material of choice for the divertor at ITER is tungsten (W) \cite{PITTS2013S48}.
The metal, named after the Swedish word for "heavy stone", is recognized for having the highest melting point of all metals and a hardness superior to that of most steels. 
In its most structurally stable form, W has a body-centered-cubic (BCC) crystal structure, with a lattice constant $a$ of 3.165 \AA (fig. \ref{Fig:bcc}).

The equilibrium position for hydrogen in W is at the tetrahedral interstitial position (TIS). 
At temperatures $T > 0$ K, any real crystalline materials will contain some amount of crystallographic defects, as described in fig. \ref{Fig:defect_types}. 
The number of these defects increases with temperature and as the result of irradiation. 
Being disruptions in the periodicity of a lattice, defects lead to an increase in the potential energy of the atomic system. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption{The BCC crystalline structure (atoms in blue). Shown in black are 8 out of 24 tetrahedral interstitial positions around the central atom.}
\label{Fig:bcc}
\end{figure}

In a W-H system, formed e.g. by placing an tungsten object under a hydrogen atmosphere, H atoms tend to lower the system energy by binding to defects. 
E.g. in the case of a vacancy in, the empty lattice site leaves neighboring W atoms with dangling bonds to which hydrogen can bind, leading to a net energy decrease compare to having H in the TIS position.

\section{Hydrogen Isotope Exchange}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The isotopes of an chemical element are essentially variants of the same element, differing in the number of neutrons and thus also having different atomic masses. 
Since all isotopes of a specific element share the same number of protons and electrons, their chemical behaviour can be considered being almost identical. 
The difference in atomic mass,  can, nonetheless, present itself as a change in the reaction rates of chemical processes when an atom is replaced by its isotope. 
This is known as the kinetic isotope effect; lighter isotopes generally react faster than their heavier counterparts. \cite{atkins2006atkins}

In the case of hydrogen, there are three naturally occurring isotopes, protium, deuterium and tritium, from here on referred to as H, D and T, respectively. 
In contrast to most other elements, the relative differences in mass between these three isotopes are notably extreme; D ($m_{\text{D}}=2.014102$ u) and T ($m_{\text{T}}=3.016049$ u) have masses of just over two and three times that of H ($m_{\text{H}}=1.007825$ u). 
These mass differences result in e.g. the isotopes having clearly different diffusion rates.
