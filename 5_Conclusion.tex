In this thesis, we have studied hydrogen isotope exchange in crystal defects of bulk tungsten using molecular dynamics. 
Due to their high prevalence in irradiated materials, our simulations targeted hydrogen accumulated into mono- and divacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries.  

Our results indicated a clear advantage in utilizing isotope exchange for removal of tritium from all the studied defect types.
Being well in line with earlier experimental work in the field \cite{ahlgren2019hydrogen}, our results provide a atom-level view into the mechanism behind isotope exchange.
